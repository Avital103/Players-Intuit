# Next Steps for Player Information Management

## Authorization
- Add authorization check to verify user permissions to view all players.

## Optimization
- Load all player information into a map with the player ID as the key and the player object as the value.
    - This enables easy access to all players or to get a player by ID with O(1) complexity instead of O(N).

## Database
- If using a database, consider using the player ID as the index for efficient retrieval.
